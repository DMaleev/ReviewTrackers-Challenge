We started with some online lending aggregators to compare rates... but it was hard to get an apples-to-apples comparison when factoring in the rates, points and various loan costs.  There is a lot of trickery going on out there, and here's a tip... if a lender approaches you instead of the other way around... run away!

Nate took the time to explain how he does business, and I immediately felt very comfortable and confident that this is the way to go!  This small company does not rely on cutting corners to be able to sell hundreds of loans to make a profit off of bulk.  As a broker, they have the advantage of getting the wholesale (not retail) rates, and can then charge a small fee, so you end up with a much better deal than you could get on your own, with a ton of added value.
