Unfortunately, this is not the latter. I cannot begin to share in depth the nature of my dissatisfaction with this organization and the parties who handled my refinance. It was headed by Chris B, loan originator.We certainly recognize that times have changed with the Covid-19 pandemic and I listened to that as an excuse for weeks, and accepted it generally as to be reasonable and understanding. However, the major basis of my complaint, and reason we will take the time to document and share such a poor experience goes beyond just the time it took (over 2.5 months) to get this done. Let's just say had I received the email I got yesterday within the 72 hour period to cancel the loan, it would have been!The loan officer, Chris B, had the worst Communication, Attention to detail, and professional advocacy that we have encountered. He had an excuse for everything and it's apparent his organizational skills are lacking. The outsourced, apparent overseas, loan processor only corresponded late at night (time zone variance I assume.) The Communication amongst them was missing glaringly, and they constantly just kept muffling the process. We nearly stopped the refinance several times and honestly had it not been for the Covid-19 and our attention focused elsewhere, we WOULD HAVE!We had enormous equity in our home, it should've been a straight forward refinance, and I feel quite often we were asked for unnecessary documentation duplicate times, even after producing. We understand the process and business of mortgage lending. Other lenders solicited us to close with them (even providing 10-20 day closing guarantees), but had already paid for appraisal and rate was 3.125% so we stuck it out.  Our documentation, records, and emails support every bit of the complaints and therefore hopefully real Quality Assurance, Training, and Monitoring will become more of their focus. It's easy when rates and times like this have record breaking applications and hundreds of millions of dollars in profits to be made, but when that dries up, service and professionalism will be the core of those who survive and endure.If their rates are WELL below others and you can deal with unprofessional responses, poor communication and a lengthy process (had excellent credit, all documents, tons of equity, this should've closed in 20 days tops) then use them, if NOT, go elsewhere.", "consumerName": "Bridget", "consumerFrom": "Murfreesboro, TN", "consumerReviewDate": "May 2020", "stars": 1}, {"title": "Good bank", "text": "Excellent experience very helpful", "consumerName": "Richard", "consumerFrom": "Kane, PA", "consumerReviewDate": "March 2018", "stars": 5}, {"title": "Great job.", "text": "It was a pleasure to work with this org. to get a loan.
