When ask for the reason why she kept saying the reason for the refusal so fast that it took until the 5th time asking when she finally slowed downed enough to tell me. It was a very lame excuse, especially since i only needed the money to help defer payments that are coming up so not to affect my credit rating. I got mad cause if they would have sent out the email to me in the morning i could have tried to find resources to get another loan somewhere else but they wasted the whole day not telling me. Even asked if i took it at a lower amount say only 3k instead of 5500 as i originally asked for and was told real fas***.no amount is going to get you a loan approval.  Yeah funny since i have a 715 credit score and i'm being treated like i have a 300 credit score.

You can do about everything needed for the loan via email and online which is very nice (I hate using the phone for this type stuff).  However, they are thorough in their process and they will ask you to call in so they can validate your identity and the background info. they pull up on you (like past employers, and past addresses, etc.).
